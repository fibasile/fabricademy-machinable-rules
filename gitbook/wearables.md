# Wearables

## Wearables

### Learning outcomes

* References and Concept development
* Design: program a microcontroller, design circuit and schematic
* Fabrication: Integrate inputs and outputs in a microcontroller wearable project
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it
* Final outcome: Assembled project, functioning and complete
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications
* Create a swatch/sample using an ATTiny/Arduino/Adafruit with one input and one output, using hard-soft connection solutions and battery
* Create 2 actuator swatches and test them with the Arduino or ATTiny, chosing from examples such as:
  1. motors / mini vibration
  1. leds / neopixels
  1. flip dot / electromagnet
  1. heat pad / with thermochromic coating
  1. speaker / mp3 player
  1. SMA (shape memory alloy)

* Learn how to program an Arduino/ATTiny/Adrafruit, documenting your process, the libraries added, power requirements and source code
* Document the schematic and circuit
* Upload a small video of your object working
* Integrate it to a project (extra credit)
