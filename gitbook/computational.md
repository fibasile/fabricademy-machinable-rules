## Computational Couture

### Learning outcomes

* References and Concept development
* Design: sketch, 3D modeling skills, Parametric modeling skills
* Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling to 3D printing, parameters, materials
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it
* Final outcome: Create a series of samples/swatches of 3D as fabric or on fabrics and a 3D parametric model.
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications on 3D printing and parametric modeling
* Design a parametric model using Grasshopper3D and upload the rhino file + grasshopper files
* Learn how to use a 3D printer and document the step-by-step process and settings
* Document the workflow for exporting your file and preparing the machine, Gcode and settings to be 3D printed
* Print your file and document the outcomes
* Upload your stl file
* Submit some of your swatches to the analog material library of your lab. Size 20cm x 20cm approx (extra credit)

## FAQ

Q Is it mandatory to use Grasshopper3D?
A. As this is one of the standard tools, that have created a large community of users and libraries around it, it is strongly recommended to try this software. But other parametric packages such as Solidworks, Blender, Autodesk Dynamo / Revit are acceptable.
