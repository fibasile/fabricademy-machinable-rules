# The Textile Scaffold

## The Textile Scaffold

### Learning outcomes

* References and Concept development
* Design: Sketch, 3D modeling skills, mould design
* Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling to 3D milling and composite making, lasercutting, crystal growing, concrete casting
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it
* Final outcome: Various samples created using different techniques
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications
* Produce 2 techniques of textile scaffold choosing from the following:
1. fabric formwork with casting
1. crystallization
1. wood-textiles composite
1. resin & bioresin -textiles composite
1. leather molding
1. other

* Document the process from CAD to CAM, the step-by-step instructions for CNC milling, mold making, vaccum forming and textile composites
* Upload your design and fabrication files, including the 3D model and CAM file
* Document at least 2 processes from design to prototyping, fabrication, materials used, document your achievements and unexpected outcomes
* Make a stop motion of your crystal growth or use 3D modeling software to simulate your design (extra credit)
