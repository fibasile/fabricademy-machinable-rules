## Skin Electronics

### Learning outcomes

* References and Concept development
* Design: Program a microcontroller, design circuit and schematic
* Fabrication: Capable of Integrating inputs and outputs in a microcontroller project
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it
* Final outcome: Is the project assembled, functioning and complete
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications
* Design a “skin-circuit”, exploring the replication of the examples bwlow or:
1. the Skin masquerade party project
1. the Twinkle Nails project
1. interactive tattoo
1. explore how to create a new skin electronics accessory.

* Document the project and included all source files and all materials used
* Upload your design files and source code
* Make a video with your skin electronic working
* Make a short performance/concept of your project functioning (extra credit)
