## Soft Robotics

### Learning outcomes

* References and Concept development
* Design: Sketch, 2D and 3D modeling, Parametric modeling and electronic skills, simulation
* Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, molding and casting, vinylcutting, laser cutting
* Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it
* Final outcome: Is the project assembled, functioning and complete
* Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated

### Student checklist

* Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications
* Make a soft robotic sample, develop the pattern for the Inflatable and draw a sketch of the air flow
1. Build a pneumatic wrist brace (basic level) or
1. Build a Soft Gripper (intermediate level) or
1. Build and document a Pneumatic, digitally controlled system, electronics schematic, electronic control and code (advanced level)
1. Design your own version of an inflatable / soft robot

* Experiment with different materials, such as silicones, 3d printing, parchment paper, thermoadesive vynil, TPU fabrics, bioplastic, document your achievements and unexpected outcomes
* Make a small video of your inflatable/soft robot working
* Upload your digital design files (if any)
* Build the electronic circuit to control your inflatable/soft robot (extra credit)
