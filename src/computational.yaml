    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and Concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant has acquired 3D modeling skills and explored parametric skills"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant is capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling to 3D printing"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Create samples/swatches of 3D printing as fabric or on fabrics and a 3D/parametric model"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic or scientific articles on 3D printing and parametric modeling"
      - "Design a parametric model using Grasshopper3D (or alternative parametric software) and upload the 3Ddesign file + required parametric files"
      - "Learn how to use a 3D printer and document the step-by-step process and settings"
      - "Document the workflow for exporting your file and preparing the machine, Gcode and settings to be 3D printed"
      - "Print your file and document the outcomes"
      - "Upload your stl file"
      - "Submit some of your swatches to the analog material library of your lab. Size 20cm x 20cm approx (extra credit)"

  Q: Is it mandatory to use Grasshopper3D?
  A: As this is one of the standard tools, that have created a large community of users and libraries around it, it is strongly recommended to try this software. But other parametric packages such as Solidworks, Blender, Autodesk Dynamo / Revit are acceptable.
  Q: Can I use a different software? how will it be evaluated?
  A: Yes you can decide to use a different parametric software, please explain why and make sure to record your screen while experimenting with the parametric file if it's not Grasshopper / Rhino. The video can be uploaded to youtube / vimeo etc and embedded in your site (to .
