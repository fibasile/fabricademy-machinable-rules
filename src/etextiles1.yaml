    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references or replicating existing projects"
      - "Design skills: the participant understands how to produce soft circuits, sensors and actuators"
      - "Fabrication skills: Learn how to embed electronics on fabrics, study soft-hard connections"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the workflow, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: The assignment is assembled and either complete or tested"
    checklist:
      - Build at least one digital and one analogue soft sensor, using different materials and techniques.
      - Document the sensor project as well as the readings got using the AnalogRead of Arduino
      - Integrate the two soft sensors into one or two textile swatches using hard soft connections
      - Document the circuit and its schematic
      - Document your swatches / samples
      - Upload your arduino code as text
      - Upload a small video of the swatches functioning
      - Integrate the swatch into a project (extra credit)

  Q: Can I make a regular electronic circuit with regular (hard) wires, breadboards, etc?
  A: A soft circuit needs to be made, be sure that your circuit can be easily attached / sewed into a fabric piece/garment and it is “comfortable” to wear / easy to use.
