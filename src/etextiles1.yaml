    description:
    outcomes:
      - References and Concept development
      - Understand how we can produce soft circuits, sensors and actuators
      - Learn how to embed electronics on fabrics
      - Study and learn soft-hard connections
      - Discover necessary materials, components, tools
      - Explore and replicate existing projects
    checklist:
      - Build at least one digital and one analogue soft sensor, using different materials and techniques.
      - Document the sensor project as well as the readings got using the AnalogRead of Arduino
      - Integrate the two soft sensors into one or two textile swatches using hard soft connections
      - Document the circuit and its schematic
      - Document your swatches / samples
      - Upload your arduino code as text
      - Upload a small video of the swatches functioning
      - Integrate the swatch into a project (extra credit)
