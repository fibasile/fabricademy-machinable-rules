  - name: Textile Scaffold
    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and Concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant has learnt through sketches, 3D modeling skills, mould design"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant is able of executing from file to production workflow, through 3D modelling, 3D milling (optional) or lasercutting, crystal growing or casting"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Various samples created using different techniques"
      - "Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications"

        Produce 2 techniques of textile scaffold choosing from the following:
            - fabric formwork with casting
            - crystallization
            - wood-textiles composite
            - resin & bioresin -textiles composite
            - leather molding
            - other
      - "Document the process including the step-by-step instructions on software, machine, mold making, vaccum forming and textile composites"
      - "Upload your design and fabrication files, including the 3D model and CAM file when possible"
      - "Document at least 2 processes from design to prototyping, fabrication, materials used, document your achievements and unexpected outcomes"
      - "Make a stop motion of your crystal growth or use 3D modeling software to simulate your design (extra credit)"

  Q: Is the use of the CNC mandatory?
  A: It is mandatory to digitally fabricate a 3d mold, through 2d/3d design, if you have access to a cnc milling machine we recommend you fabricate through cnc milling, otherwise lasercutting and/or 3d printing.
