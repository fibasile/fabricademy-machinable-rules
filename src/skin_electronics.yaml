  - name: Skin Electronics
    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant learnt to program a microcontroller, design circuit and schematic"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant is able of integrating inputs and outputs in a microcontroller project"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Is the assignment is assembled, functioning or tested"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications"
      - |
        Design a “skin-circuit”, exploring the replication of the examples bwlow or:
            - the Skin masquerade party project
            - the Twinkle Nails project
            - interactive tattoo
            - explore how to create a new skin electronics accessory.
      - "Document the project and included all source files and all materials used"
      - "Upload your design files and source code"
      - "Make a video with your skin electronic working"
      - "Make a short performance/concept of your project functioning (extra credit)"

  Q: How is this different from wearables?
  A: For skin electronics the circuit should be a wearable placed on the skin (mask, hair, tattoo, patch, glove, nails)
  Q: Do I need to use a microcontroller?
  A: Yes, you should use a small microcontroller  that can be hidden - such as ATtiny, gemma or other similar 
  Q: Can it be connected to a power supply or computer?
  A: No, your wearables should be powered by battery.
