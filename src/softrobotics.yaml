    outcomes:
      - "References and Concept development"
      - "Design: Sketch, 2D and 3D modeling, Parametric modeling and electronic skills, simulation"
      - "Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, molding and casting, vinylcutting, laser cutting"
      - "Documentation: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Is the project assembled, functioning and complete"
      - "Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications?"

        Make a soft robotic sample, develop the pattern for the Inflatable and draw a sketch of the air flow:
            - build a pneumatic wrist brace (basic level) or
            - build a Soft Gripper (intermediate level) or
            - build and document a Pneumatic, digitally controlled system, electronics schematic, electronic control and code (advanced level)
            - design your own version of an inflatable / soft robot
      - "Experiment with different materials, such as silicones, 3d printing, parchment paper, thermoadesive vynil, TPU fabrics, bioplastic, document your achievements and unexpected outcomes"
      - "Make a small video of your inflatable/soft robot working"
      - "Upload your digital design files (if any)"
      - "Build the electronic circuit to control your inflatable/soft robot (extra credit)"
