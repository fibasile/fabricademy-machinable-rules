  Q: Should be all the files uploaded to the GitLab, or can I use Drive, Dropbox instead?
  A: No. Everything should be uploaded into GitLab. Bigger files - when a file is larger than 10 MB - should be zipped, then uploaded.
      (FYI: Files hosted externally have the risk of being deleted/lost long term if external accounts are not maintained.)
      Be sure that all the important content (presentations, design and fabrication files) necessary for explain or replicate your final project/assignment are in GitLab.
