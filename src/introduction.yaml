  Q: Should be all the files uploaded to the GitLab, or can I use Drive, Dropbox instead?
  A: Everything should be uploaded into GitLab except the bigger files - when a file is larger than 10 MB. 
      (FYI: Files hosted externally have the risk of being deleted/lost long term if external accounts are not maintained.)
      Be sure that all the important content (presentations, design and fabrication files) necessary for replate your final project/assignment is in GitLab.
