    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant has learnt through sketches & prototypes, material choices, 2D vector design"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant acquired skills necessary for laser cutting, digital workflow, assemblying, material used and leftovers"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the workflow, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: The assignment is assembled and either complete or tested"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Include some inspiration: research on artists or projects that work with modules and zero waste systems"
      - "Document, Design and prototype with paper and scissors modular configurations and interlocking connections"
      - "Document, Design and prototype digitally your modular configurations and interlocking connections in 2D"
      - "Document the process of testing and laser cutting your designs, including the machine settings, material type and thickness"
      - "Laser cut the modules. Create a modular or seamless garment, showing that the connection is well-designed and holds the pull/stretch. Document the assembly process and tests"
      - "Upload the fabrication PDF file at [oscircularfashion.com](https://oscircularfashion.com), in 1:1 scale accompanied by 1-5 pictures (preferably in white background)"
      - "Submit some of the modules to the analog or digital material library of the lab. (Recommended size 20cm x 20cm) (extra credit)"
