  - name: Wearables
    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and Concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant has learnt by programming a microcontroller, design a circuit and schematic"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant acquired skills necessary to integrate inputs and outputs in a microcontroller wearable project"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Assembled project, functioning and complete"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Document the concept, sketches, references also to artistic and scientific publications"
      - "Create a swatch/sample using an ATTiny/Arduino/Adafruit with one input and one output, using hard-soft connection solutions and battery"
      - |
        Create 2 actuator swatches and test them with the Arduino or ATTiny, chosing from examples such as:
            - motors / mini vibration
            - leds / neopixels
            - flip dot / electromagnet
            - heat pad / with thermochromic coating
            - speaker / mp3 player
            - SMA (shape memory alloy)
      - "Learn how to program an Arduino/ATTiny/Adrafruit, documenting your process, the libraries added, power requirements and source code"
      - "Document the schematic and circuit"
      - "Upload a small video of your object working"
      - "Integrate it to a project (extra credit)"
