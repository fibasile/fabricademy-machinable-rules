  - name: Open Source Hardware - from fibers to fabrics
    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and Concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participant has learnt through sketches, 3D modeling, use of electronics, etc"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant is capable of executing from file to production workflow, from 3D modelling to digital fabrication, electronics, materials"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the process, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: The assignment is assembled and either complete or tested"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated?"
    checklist:
      - "Research and document existing fabrication methods, machines and industries, add references, tutorials and sketches of the hardware you will make"
      - "Document the process of designing the files for your machine/machine-hack/tool and its fabrication including the assembly process"
      - "Document the schematic and the software source code (if any)"
      - "Document the parts and how to make your tool or machine"
      - "Document your BOM (Bill of materials): electronics, materials, their amount, etcetera (with references of the components)"
      - "Upload your 3D model and CAM files (if any)"
      - "Design, create and document a final outcome, a sample project of your process"
      - "Make a small video of the machine"
      - "Create an interface for controling your machine (extra credit)"
