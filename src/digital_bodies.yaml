    outcomes:
      - "References and Concept development"
      - "Design: 3D scanning, 3D file manipulation, mesh repair tools, explore 3D programs (open and closed sourced)"
      - "Fabrication: Capable of executing from file to production workflow, from slicer to laser cutting"
      - "Documentation: Anyone can go through the workflow, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: Is the project assembled, functioning and complete"
      - "Originality - Aesthetics: Has the design been thought through and elaborated"
    checklist:
      - "Include some inspiration: research on artists or projects that work with the human body"
      - "Document the use of 3D scanner and software to acquire a 3D model"
      - "Document the process of repairing and/or manipulating a 3D mesh and slicing it"
      - "Document the process of file preparation for laser cutting"
      - "Learn how to laser cut, document the workflow including the machine settings, material type and thickness"
      - "Upload your 3D file (STL/OBJ) and your 2D files (DXF/PDF)"
      - "Build and/or assemble a mannequin or body parts"
      - "Create a stop motion or step-by-step assemblying process and upload one picture (HIGH RES) of your mannequin (extra credit)"
