    description:
    outcomes:
      - "Research skills: the participant has acquired knowledge through references and Concept development"
      - "Design skills: the participants has acquired knowledge on 3D scanning and modelling, mesh repair or manipulation"
      - "Fabrication skills: the participant is capable of executing from file to production workflow, from slicer to laser cutting"
      - "Process skills: Anyone can go through the workflow, understand it and reproduce it"
      - "Final outcome: The assignment is assembled and either complete or tested"
      - "Originality: Has the design been thought through and elaborated"
    checklist:
      - "Include some inspiration: research on artists or projects that work with the human body"
      - "Document the use of 3D scanner and software to acquire a 3D model"
      - "Document the process of repairing and/or manipulating a 3D mesh and slicing it"
      - "Document the process of file preparation for laser cutting"
      - "Learn how to laser cut, document the workflow including the machine settings, material type and thickness"
      - "Upload your 3D file (STL/OBJ) and your 2D files (DXF/PDF)"
      - "Build and/or assemble a mannequin or body parts"
      - "Create a stop motion or step-by-step assemblying process and upload one picture (HIGH RES) of your mannequin (extra credit)"

  Q: Can I upload the big `.stl` files obtained from the scanning?
  A: You can create an account at https://sketchfab.com/ and/or https://cults3d.com/en
  Q: Is there a minimum size for the body/body part to be fabricated this week?
  A: There is not a minimum size for a body or body part to be fabricated, as long as the learning process of working from physical - to digital - back to physical fabrication is understood and achieved. Its not necessary to work on a full 1:1 scale either when making a full body, as important learning challenges and mistakes can lead to unwanted material waste.
  Q: Is the lasercutter use a requirement for this week?
  A: Use of the laser cutter is an important mastery for this week, but its also a minimum requirement rather than an exclusive one. When participants already master the local lab protocols for operating the laser cutter, they are allowed to additionally include other techniques or technologies.
  Q: Does the mannequin have to be functional or can it be decorative or an art piece?
  A: The body created is not required to have a specific function, it can function as a mannequin or last for a shoe or hat mould, but it can also simply be of artistic expression and research in understanding the form of a body in 3d through digital fabrication.
  Q: Can any software be used?
  A: Rhino is not a requirement but suggested in preparation to the parametric class, otherwise Blender and Fusion are good altrernatives
  Q: How much material can be used?
  A: Participants should not exceed 6 sheets of 1000x600mm, we suggest to avoid the use of acrylic.
